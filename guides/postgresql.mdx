<Note>
    This guide will walk you through the process of creating a secure, read-only
    PostgreSQL user specifically for connecting to the application.
</Note>

## Why Create a Read-Only User?

Creating a dedicated read-only user ensures:

1. **Enhanced Security**: Limits potential data manipulation risks.
2. **Data Integrity**: Prevents accidental modifications to your database.
3. **Compliance**: Adheres to the principle of least privilege.

## Step-by-Step Guide

Follow these steps to create your PostgreSQL read-only user:

### 1. Connect to PostgreSQL

First, connect to your PostgreSQL server as a superuser (usually 'postgres'):

<CodeBlock language="bash">psql -U postgres</CodeBlock>

### 2. Create the Read-Only User

Create a new user with a secure password:

<CodeBlock language="sql">
    CREATE USER readonly WITH PASSWORD 'your_secure_password';
</CodeBlock>

<Warning>
    Replace 'your_secure_password' with a strong, unique password. Consider
    using a password manager to generate and store this securely.
</Warning>

### 3. Grant Connect Privilege

Grant the user the ability to connect to the database:

<CodeBlock language="sql">
    GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE your_database TO readonly;
</CodeBlock>

### 4. Grant Schema Usage

Grant usage on the schema(s) you want the user to access:

<CodeBlock language="sql">GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO readonly;</CodeBlock>

### 5. Grant Select Privileges

Grant SELECT privileges on all tables in the schema:

<CodeBlock language="sql">
    GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO readonly; ALTER DEFAULT
    PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO readonly;
</CodeBlock>

### 6. Grant Additional Necessary Privileges

For the application to function correctly, grant a few more privileges:

<CodeBlock language="sql">
    GRANT USAGE ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO readonly; GRANT SELECT ON
    ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO readonly;
</CodeBlock>

These permissions allow the user to:

-   Access and read sequences (often used for ID columns)
-   See the structure of the database objects

## Verifying the User Setup

To confirm that the user has been set up correctly:

1. Connect to PostgreSQL as the new read-only user:

    <CodeBlock language="bash">psql -U readonly -d your_database</CodeBlock>

2. Try to select data from a table:

    <CodeBlock language="sql">SELECT * FROM table_name LIMIT 5;</CodeBlock>

3. Attempt to modify data (this should fail):
    <CodeBlock language="sql">
        INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2) VALUES ('test', 'data');
    </CodeBlock>

<Tip>
    If you can select data but not modify it, your read-only user is set up
    correctly!
</Tip>

## Connecting to Your Application

When setting up your connection in your application:

1. Use the hostname of your PostgreSQL server
2. Enter 'readonly' as the username
3. Use the secure password you set in step 2
4. Specify the database name you granted access to in step 3

<Info>
    For additional security, consider using SSL connections and restricting the
    'readonly' user to specific IP addresses if your application connects from
    known IP ranges.
</Info>

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

-   Check the PostgreSQL log files for detailed error messages
-   Verify that all necessary privileges have been granted
-   Ensure the user has been created successfully
-   Confirm that your PostgreSQL server allows remote connections if your application is hosted externally
-   Check that you're using the correct hostname, username, password, and database name in your application

For further assistance, consult your database administrator or refer to the official PostgreSQL documentation.

By following this guide, you've created a secure, read-only PostgreSQL user that's perfectly suited for connecting to your application. This setup ensures that your data remains protected while allowing your application to perform necessary read operations effectively.
