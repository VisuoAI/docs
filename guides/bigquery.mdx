## Why Create a Service Key?

A service key for BigQuery provides:

1. **Secure Access**: Allows applications to authenticate with BigQuery without using personal credentials.
2. **Controlled Permissions**: Enables fine-grained access control to BigQuery resources.
3. **Automation**: Facilitates automated processes and CI/CD pipelines interacting with BigQuery.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

-   A Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account
-   A project set up in GCP

## Step-by-Step Guide

Follow these steps to create a service key for BigQuery:

### 1. Enable the BigQuery API

<Steps>
    <Step title="Open Google Cloud Console">
        Go to
        [https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Navigate to APIs & Services">
        In the left navigation menu, click on "APIs & Services" > "Dashboard"
    </Step>
    <Step title="Enable BigQuery API">
        Click "+ ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES" at the top of the page Search for
        "BigQuery API" and select it Click "ENABLE" if it's not already enabled
    </Step>
</Steps>

### 2. Navigate to the IAM & Admin Console

<Steps>
    <Step title="Access IAM & Admin">
        In the left navigation menu, click on "IAM & Admin" > "Service Accounts"
    </Step>
</Steps>

### 3. Create a New Service Account

<Steps>
    <Step title="Click 'Create Service Account'">
        At the top of the page, click the "Create Service Account" button
    </Step>
    <Step title="Enter Service Account Details">
        - Service account name: Choose a descriptive name (e.g.,
        "bigquery-admin") - Service account ID: This will auto-generate, but you
        can customize it - Description: Optional, but recommended for clarity
    </Step>
    <Step title="Click 'Create and Continue'">
        This will create the service account
    </Step>
</Steps>

### 4. Assign Roles to the Service Account

<Steps>
    <Step title="Select Roles">
        Choose the BigQuery Admin role for full access
    </Step>
    <Step title="Click 'Continue'">
        After selecting roles, click "Continue"
    </Step>
    <Step title="Grant User Access (Optional)">
        You can grant users access to this service account if needed
    </Step>
    <Step title="Click 'Done'">
        This completes the service account creation
    </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  The BigQuery Admin role provides full control over BigQuery resources, including creating, updating, and deleting datasets, tables, and jobs. It's recommended for administrative access, but you can choose more restrictive roles based on your specific needs. Other roles include:

-   BigQuery Data Viewer: Read-only access to data
-   BigQuery User: Ability to run queries and jobs
-   BigQuery Job User: Ability to create and manage jobs

Choose the role that best fits your use case and follows the principle of least privilege.

### 5. Create and Download the Key

<Steps>
    <Step title="Find Your Service Account">
        In the Service Accounts list, find the account you just created
    </Step>
    <Step title="Access Key Management">
        Click on the three dots in the "Actions" column and select "Manage keys"
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add Key">Click "Add Key" and choose "Create new key"</Step>
    <Step title="Select Key Type">
        Choose "JSON" as the key type and click "Create"
    </Step>
    <Step title="Save the Key">
        The key file will automatically download. Keep this file secure!
    </Step>
</Steps>

    The JSON key file contains sensitive information. Never commit it to version
    control or share it publicly.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

-   Rotate your service account keys regularly
-   Use the principle of least privilege when assigning roles
-   Monitor and audit the usage of service accounts
