<Note>
    This guide will walk you through the process of creating a secure, read-only
    MariaDB user specifically for connecting to the application.
</Note>

## Why Create a Read-Only User?

Creating a dedicated read-only user ensures:

1. **Enhanced Security**: Limits potential data manipulation risks.
2. **Data Integrity**: Prevents accidental modifications to your database.
3. **Compliance**: Adheres to the principle of least privilege.

## Step-by-Step Guide

Follow these steps to create your MariaDB read-only user:

### 1. Connect to MariaDB

First, connect to your MariaDB server as a user with administrative privileges:

<CodeBlock language="bash">mysql -u root -p</CodeBlock>

### 2. Create the Read-Only User

Create a new user with a secure password:

<CodeBlock language="sql">
    CREATE USER 'readonly'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_secure_password';
</CodeBlock>

<Warning>
    Replace 'your_secure_password' with a strong, unique password. Consider
    using a password manager to generate and store this securely.
</Warning>

### 3. Grant Select Privileges

Grant SELECT privileges on all databases:

<CodeBlock language="sql">GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'readonly'@'%';</CodeBlock>

This allows the user to read data from any table in any database, but not modify it.

### 4. Grant Additional Necessary Privileges

For the application to function correctly, grant a few more privileges:

<CodeBlock language="sql">
    GRANT SHOW VIEW, SHOW DATABASES, PROCESS ON *.* TO 'readonly'@'%';
</CodeBlock>

These permissions allow the user to:

-   `SHOW VIEW`: See the structure of views
-   `SHOW DATABASES`: List available databases
-   `PROCESS`: View information about threads executing in the server

### 5. Apply the Changes

Finally, apply these changes:

<CodeBlock language="sql">FLUSH PRIVILEGES;</CodeBlock>

This command reloads the privileges table, ensuring our new user and its permissions take effect immediately.

## Verifying the User Setup

To confirm that the user has been set up correctly:

1. Log in to MariaDB as the new read-only user:

    <CodeBlock language="bash">mysql -u readonly -p</CodeBlock>

2. Try to select data from a table:

    <CodeBlock language="sql">
        SELECT * FROM database_name.table_name LIMIT 5;
    </CodeBlock>

3. Attempt to modify data (this should fail):
    <CodeBlock language="sql">
        INSERT INTO database_name.table_name (column1, column2) VALUES ('test',
        'data');
    </CodeBlock>

<Tip>
    If you can select data but not modify it, your read-only user is set up
    correctly!
</Tip>

## Connecting to Your Application

When setting up your connection in your application:

1. Use the hostname of your MariaDB server
2. Enter 'readonly' as the username
3. Use the secure password you set in step 2
4. Specify the default database you want to analyze (if applicable)

<Info>
    For additional security, consider restricting the 'readonly' user to
    specific IP addresses if your application connects from known IP ranges.
</Info>

## MariaDB-Specific Notes

-   **Compatibility with MySQL**: MariaDB is a fork of MySQL and maintains high compatibility. Most MySQL commands work identically in MariaDB.
-   **Performance Schema**: If you're using the Performance Schema, ensure the read-only user has appropriate permissions to access it if needed.
-   **Plugin-Specific Permissions**: If you're using any MariaDB-specific plugins, you may need to grant additional permissions related to those plugins.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

-   Check the MariaDB error log for detailed error messages
-   Verify that all necessary privileges have been granted
-   Ensure the user has been created successfully
-   Confirm that your MariaDB server allows remote connections if your application is hosted externally
-   Check that you're using the correct hostname, username, password, and database name in your application

For further assistance, consult your database administrator or refer to the official MariaDB documentation.

## Must-Know Details

1. **my.cnf Configuration**: Ensure this file is configured to allow connections from your application's IP address.
2. **SSL Connections**: For enhanced security, consider using SSL for connections. You may need to configure SSL certificates and adjust user privileges accordingly.
3. **User Account Limits**: MariaDB allows setting resource limits for user accounts. Consider implementing these for the read-only user if needed.
4. **Replication Considerations**: If you're using MariaDB replication, ensure the read-only user has appropriate permissions on replica servers if applicable.

By following this guide, you've created a secure, read-only MariaDB user that's perfectly suited for connecting to your application. This setup ensures that your data remains protected while allowing your application to perform necessary read operations effectively.
