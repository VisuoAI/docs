<Note>
    This guide will walk you through the process of creating a secure, read-only
    Supabase user specifically for connecting to the application. Supabase uses
    PostgreSQL, so some steps will be similar to PostgreSQL setup.
</Note>

## Why Create a Read-Only User?

Creating a dedicated read-only user ensures:

1. **Enhanced Security**: Limits potential data manipulation risks.
2. **Data Integrity**: Prevents accidental modifications to your database.
3. **Compliance**: Adheres to the principle of least privilege.

## Step-by-Step Guide

Follow these steps to create your Supabase read-only user:

### 1. Access Supabase SQL Editor

First, log in to your Supabase project and navigate to the SQL Editor.

### 2. Create the Read-Only User

Create a new user with a secure password:

<CodeBlock language="sql">
    CREATE USER readonly WITH PASSWORD 'your_secure_password';
</CodeBlock>

<Warning>
    Replace 'your_secure_password' with a strong, unique password. Consider
    using a password manager to generate and store this securely.
</Warning>

### 3. Grant Connect Privilege

Grant the user the ability to connect to the database:

<CodeBlock language="sql">
    GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE postgres TO readonly;
</CodeBlock>

<Note>In Supabase, the main database is typically named 'postgres'.</Note>

### 4. Grant Schema Usage

Grant usage on the public schema and any other schemas you want the user to access:

<CodeBlock language="sql">GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO readonly;</CodeBlock>

### 5. Grant Select Privileges

Grant SELECT privileges on all tables in the schema:

<CodeBlock language="sql">
    GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO readonly; ALTER DEFAULT
    PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO readonly;
</CodeBlock>

### 6. Grant Additional Necessary Privileges

For full read-only access, grant privileges on sequences:

<CodeBlock language="sql">
    GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO readonly;
</CodeBlock>

### 7. Apply Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

Ensure that appropriate Row Level Security policies are in place:

<CodeBlock language="sql">
ALTER TABLE your_table ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Read access for readonly user"
ON your_table FOR SELECT
TO readonly
USING (true);

</CodeBlock>

<Tip>
    Repeat the above for each table that needs RLS. Adjust the USING clause as
    needed to restrict access to specific rows.
</Tip>

## Verifying the User Setup

To confirm that the user has been set up correctly:

1. Use the Supabase SQL Editor to run queries as the readonly user:

    <CodeBlock language="sql">
        SET ROLE readonly; SELECT * FROM your_table LIMIT 5;
    </CodeBlock>

2. Attempt to modify data (this should fail):
    <CodeBlock language="sql">
        SET ROLE readonly; INSERT INTO your_table (column1, column2) VALUES
        ('test', 'data');
    </CodeBlock>

<Tip>
    If you can select data but not modify it, your read-only user is set up
    correctly!
</Tip>

## Connecting to Your Application

When setting up your connection in your application:

1. Use the Supabase project's connection string or host
2. Enter 'readonly' as the username
3. Use the secure password you set in step 2
4. Use the default database name (typically 'postgres')

<Info>
    Supabase provides connection information in the project settings. Make sure
    to use these details when configuring your application.
</Info>

## Supabase-Specific Notes

-   **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Supabase heavily relies on RLS. Ensure your RLS policies are correctly set up for the readonly user.
-   **Realtime Subscriptions**: If using Supabase's realtime features, ensure the readonly user has appropriate permissions for subscriptions.
-   **Supabase API**: If you're using Supabase's API, you'll need to create an API key with read-only permissions instead of a database user.
-   **Supabase Functions**: For serverless functions, use appropriate service roles that have read-only access.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

-   Check the Supabase logs in the dashboard for detailed error messages
-   Verify that all necessary privileges have been granted
-   Ensure the user has been created successfully
-   Check that you're using the correct connection details in your application
-   Verify that RLS policies are not overly restrictive

For further assistance, consult the Supabase documentation or community forums.

## Must-Know Details

1. **Connection Pooling**: Supabase uses PgBouncer for connection pooling. Be aware of this when troubleshooting connection issues.
2. **SSL Connections**: Supabase enforces SSL connections. Ensure your application supports this.
3. **Automatic Backups**: Supabase provides automatic backups. The readonly user won't affect these, but it's good to be aware of this feature.
4. **Schema Migrations**: When applying schema migrations, remember to update permissions for the readonly user if new tables or schemas are added.
5. **Supabase Dashboard**: While you can create a readonly database user, many operations in Supabase are designed to be done through the dashboard or API.

By following this guide, you've created a secure, read-only Supabase user that's perfectly suited for connecting to your application. This setup ensures that your data remains protected while allowing your application to perform necessary read operations effectively.
